## Advanced Tips

### Private Repos & GitHub Pages
- **GitHub API only shows public repos** (unless you authenticate, which this app does not do)
- **Private repos will NOT appear in the repo browser or search**
- **However, if you know your private repo has a public GitHub Pages site, you can manually construct the URL:**
  - The pattern is: `https://username.github.io/reponame/`
  - Example: If your public repo is `junkerfamily/MyFavorites` (GitHub Pages: `https://junkerfamily.github.io/MyFavorites/`), and your private repo is `junkerfamily/EZ_Message`, you can try `https://junkerfamily.github.io/EZ_Message/` (if the site is published)
  - **Just add this URL manually as a favorite!**
- **Pro tip:** You can base your GitHub Pages URL off a public repo, then change the repo name in the URL to match your private repo (if you know the site is published)

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't I find my private repo in the search?**
A: GitHub's public API only returns public repositories. Private repos are hidden for privacy. You can still add their URLs manually if you know them.

**Q: My favorites disappeared!**
A: Some browsers (especially iOS Safari) may clear localStorage. Use Export or Backup Link to prevent data loss.

**Q: Can I use this app offline?**
A: Yes! Once loaded, it works offline (except for GitHub API features).
